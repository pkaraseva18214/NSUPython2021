You can blame me for the world is mad
And the good old rock'n'roll is dead
Burning down like falling stars
Wasting life behind the bars
Life of ignorance is bliss
And I don't know why I'm doing this
You can take me for what I am
I was born a wild man, hey!
Don't crucify me, I'm no Jesus
I'm a sinner and a prodigal son
Don't crucify me, I'm no Jesus
I'm a sinner
I've been traveling seven seas
Trains and highways and STDs
Fell in love a million times
Drank tequila and got high
You can blame me for the world is mad
And the good old rock'n'roll is dead
You can take me for what I am
I was born a wild man, hey!
